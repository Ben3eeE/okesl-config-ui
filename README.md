# OKESL Config UI

OKESL Config UI is a graphical user interface for configuring controls in the OKESL project. It allows users to bind keys to specific commands and save/load configurations in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

- Bind keys to commands such as `Throttle`, `Brake`, `Alovolt`, and more.
- Save and load configurations to/from a file.
- User-friendly UI built with ImGui.
- Special handling for commands like `Alovolt` and `Load`.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: A compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- **Meson Build System**: Version 0.55.0 or later.
- **SDL2**: For handling input and events.
- **ImGui**: For the graphical user interface.
- **nlohmann/json**: For JSON parsing (if applicable).

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/okesl-config-ui.git
   cd okesl-config-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure the following libraries are installed on your system:
   - Meson
   - Ninja (build tool)

   On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install meson ninja-build
   ```

3. **Configure the Build**:
   Use Meson to configure the build directory:
   ```bash
   meson setup builddir
   ```

4. **Build the Project**:
   Compile the project using Ninja:
   ```bash
   meson compile -C builddir
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   After building, you can run the application:
   ```bash
   ./builddir/okesl-config-ui
   ```

## File Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the project.
- **`resources/cfg/`**: Contains example configuration files.
- **`include/`**: Header files for the project.
- **`subprojects/`**: External dependencies (e.g., ImGui, SDL2).
- **`builddir/`**: Build directory generated by Meson.

## Configuration File Format

The configuration file uses the following format:
```properties
# Section Heading
bind [modifier][key] "[command1;command2]"
```

### Example:
```properties
# Elma Controls
bind *up "throttle;spy_up"
bind *down "brake;spy_down"
bind +q "ofbrake"
bind *left "left;spy_left"
bind *right "right;spy_right"
bind *rctrl "left;right"
bind *space "turn"

# Saveload Controls
bind +f3 "save"
bind +f4 "load;resetdata"
bind *f4 "hold"
```
